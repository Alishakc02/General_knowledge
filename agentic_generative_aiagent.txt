1. Agentic AI
Agentic AI refers to AI systems that exhibit agency—the ability to autonomously perceive their environment, make decisions, and act upon those decisions to achieve specific goals. These systems can plan, learn from interactions, and adapt their behavior dynamically without constant human input.

Key feature: Autonomy and goal-oriented behavior
Examples: Autonomous robots, self-driving cars, and AI-powered digital assistants that proactively perform tasks
2. Generative AI
Generative AI focuses on creating new content based on patterns learned from existing data. It can produce text, images, music, code, and more. Unlike agentic AI, generative AI primarily generates rather than acts in the environment.

Key feature: Content creation through learned data patterns
Examples: ChatGPT (text generation), DALL·E (image generation), and music composition AI
3. AI Agent
An AI Agent is a broad term that refers to any AI system that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon it through actuators to achieve objectives. It can be either simple (reactive agent) or complex (learning and planning agent). Essentially, an AI Agent is the embodiment of agentic AI principles.

Key feature: Interaction with an environment to perform tasks
Examples: Chatbots responding to user queries, game AI characters, and recommendation systems
